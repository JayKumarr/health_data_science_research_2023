Students will be assigned to groups (if class size is moderate then individual projects may be possible) in the first week of class and throughout the course will collaboratively develop a research proposal. There will be weekly class time (wedneday B) dedicated to training in the specifics of  developing research proposals and for group work on the proposal. However, the groups will be expected to coordinate with one another and work on the proposal outside of class time as well. The final reports will be presented by the groups to the rest of the class during the last week of the course with Q&A from the other course participants. This will be followed by submission of a group written report including a statement of contribution that clearly indicates each team member's contribution to the proposal.  

See schedule for key dates.
